\title{create a scatter plot of the model alpha (trascription rate) vs. the naive
estimator (RNA / DNA).}
\usage{
plotAlphaRatio(obj, condition = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{the MpraObject}

\item{condition}{if NULL (default) create a single plot of the model baseline
(intercept) vs the total data. Else, condition must be a valid factor in the 
object column annotations that was included in the design. In that case, a 
plot is generated for each level of the factor}
