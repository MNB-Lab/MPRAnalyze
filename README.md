## MPRAnalyze ##
### Comparing enhancer strength based on MPRA experiments ###

MPRAnalyze is an analysis framework for MPRA data that aims at translating the main scientific questions arising in the context of MPRA data into statistical problems.
Such questions include variations of ranking enhancers by caused expression magnitude 
and testing for differential enhancer activity between conditions.
Thereby, MPRAnalyze allows the user to answer those questions as part of a likelihood-based framework based on p-values and expression strength scores.

### INSTALLATION

Currently not installable! Instead, all functions are loaded into your current R session.
Clone the GitHub repository first into you local target directory.
Then, from your rsession, e.g. in RStudio, load the wrapper functions via source("MPRAnalyze/R/main_MPRAnalyze.R").
You can now use MPRAnalyze via the wrapper functions.
