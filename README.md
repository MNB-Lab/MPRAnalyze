## MPRAnalyze ##

MPRAnalyze is an analysis framework designed for data generated by Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRAs). MPRAnlayze can be used for quantification of enhancer-induced transcription rates, calssification of active\inactive enhancers, and comparative analyses of enhancer activity between conditions.

### INSTALLATION

MPRAnalyze will soon be released via bioconductor, and could be installed using the BiocManager package:
```r
BiocManager::install("MPRAnalyze")
```

Until then, MPRAnalyze can be installed directly from the Yosef lab github, using the devtools install_github function:
```r
library(devtools)
install_github("YosefLab/MPRAnalyze")
```
